The project leverages on the Scrapy module to crawl data from IMDB and then, mainly Pandas and Matplotlib for the subsequent analysis.

The structure is as follows:

CRAWLING SCRIPT:
The crawling script can be run in the command line with the following command:
scrapy crawl imdbspider

The script is contained in imdb_spider.py file where the name of the spider is defined as 'imdbspider'.
Using the Scrapy module, it will crawl the IMDB Top 250 page http://www.imdb.com/chart/top as well as each movie
link to scrape the movie data. It will generate the IMDBTop250.csv file containing the data obtained.
Each field of the movie item is defined in items.py.
The following movie data will be obtained:
1) rank
2) movie_id
3) title
4) year
5) movie_link
6) genre
7) rating
8) votes
9) origin
10) runtime_mins
11) awards_nominations
12) awards_wins
13) gross_worldwide_usd


PYTHON PROGRAMS:
Main
The main program for the project is main.py. Running this application will also run the spider from imdb_spider.py
so that there is no need to run two scripts separately.
After running the crawling script and the IMDBTop250.csv file has been generated, the analysis module will be ran.
This will give a brief analysis of the IMDB Top 250 data.

Scrapy already uses logging for event logging (for more information, https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html)
so I have made no alteration to the Scrapy logs as the existing data is useful for debugging and checking data stats.
Logs are saved in logs.txt

Analysis
Topic: What factors influence the IMDB rating?

Among the quantitative data available on IMDB, the following can be explored as to whether the values are related
to the rating of each movie:
1) Number of votes - we want to check whether 
2) Runtime (length of the movie)
3) Number of awards (won)
4) Gross box office (worldwide)
